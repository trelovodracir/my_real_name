# My Real Name - Python

This is a simple project developed in Python that reverses my reversed name and restores the word order with the first letter capitalized, thus displaying my original name.

## Description

The main function of this project, `inverter_nome`, receives a string with reversed words of a name and arranges them correctly. The function also capitalizes the first letter of each word. This project aims to demonstrate how to manipulate strings in Python and the importance of using good coding practices.

## How it works

The code contains a function that:

1. Receives a string with the words of a name reversed.

2. Reverses the order of the words.

3. Reverses each word individually and capitalizes the first letter.

4. Returns the original name in the correct format.

### Example

Run the code:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Input:
```python
nome_invertido = "Trelov Razec Odracir"
```
Output:
```text
Meu nome Ã©: Ricardo Cezar Volert
```
